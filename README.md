# Student Portfolio Hub

The Student Portfolio Hub is a centralized platform designed to showcase the academic achievements, projects, and experiences of students. This repository serves as a digital portfolio repository, where students can upload and manage their portfolios, allowing them to highlight their skills, knowledge, and accomplishments.

There are two part of this Web Application i.e. Student and Faculty. Both have different servers but both portals are directing to database. To run this successfully you must have mongoDB application and some prior data of students.

The Student Portfolio Hub also includes an admin panel that allows administrators to manage and review student portfolios.
